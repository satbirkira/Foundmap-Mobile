Introduction
-------
The android app for the minimal viable product Foundmap. Instead of re-implementing all features using the mapbox-sdk, it simply loads Foundmap.com in a WebView, after displaying a splash screen.

Notes
-------
Foundmap is hosted on a low budget server and so it may take some time to load.
